## Description
This is a helper task designed specifically for a Cedrus StimTracker (Quad or Duo) to set up a pulse table of synchronizing triggers with random intervals. These triggers allow accurate offline alignment of recordings from multiple devices. Currently, it is used to synchronize eego mylab amplifiers (ANT-Neuro) with clinical SOMNOscreen HD in-lab PSG systems (SOMNOmedics) at Stanford Sleep Medicine Center.

## Outcome measures
- None
